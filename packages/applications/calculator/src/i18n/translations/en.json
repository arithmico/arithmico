  "about.aboutArithmico.description1": "Arithmico is an accessible application developed for blind and visually impaired people. As a scientific calculator, Arithmico supports a wide range of scientific disciplines. The platform-independent software can be used both online and offline and works seamlessly with screen readers and Braille displays. In addition to the basic functions, Arithmico offers the option of creating function graphs that can be made tactile for blind users. In addition, Arithmico can be flexibly adapted to specific examination requirements by providing an offline version with a reduced range of functions.",
  "about.aboutArithmico.description2": "The open-source project was launched in 2019 by Lennard Behrens and was driven forward by him over a long period alongside his studies and career. Later, Tizian Roth joined the software development team and significantly supported its technical advancement. In April 2024, the project recorded more than 22,000 monthly visits for the first time. Today, Arithmico is used at the <1>Deutsche Blindenstudienanstalt (blista)</1> and other schools with a focus on visual impairment in Germany and Austria, promoting inclusive education through its accessibility. In close cooperation with the <2>Math4VIP</2> project, led by Prof. Dr. habil. Ilka Agricola and Dr. Kai Kortus from Philipps University of Marburg, and in collaboration with blista, Arithmico is being continuously developed to improve accessibility in education for visually impaired and blind individuals.",
